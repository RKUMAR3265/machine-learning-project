# machine-learning-project 
In the digital age, information is shared at an unprecedented speed, with social media platforms, 
blogs, and online news portals enabling instant communication and access to news content. 
While this has revolutionized the way people consume information, it has also made it easier 
for misinformation and fake news to proliferate. 
Fake news not only misleads readers but also has the potential to influence elections, spread 
fear, damage reputations, and create social unrest. Manual fact-checking, while effective, 
cannot scale to meet the sheer volume of content generated every second. This has created an 
urgent need for automated systems that can reliably detect fake content. 
Machine learning, particularly in combination with natural language processing (NLP), 
provides powerful tools to address this challenge. These technologies enable systems to analyze 
text for signs of deception, bias, or factual inconsistency. This project aims to explore these 
technologies by comparing traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models 
such as BERT. 
By training models on the LIAR dataset, which contains thousands of labeled political 
statements, the project attempts to identify the most effective method for classifying news 
content as true or false. Our analysis also focuses on the trade-offs in terms of performance, 
accuracy, and computational requirements, ultimately guiding the development of scalable 
solutions for real-world deployment.
